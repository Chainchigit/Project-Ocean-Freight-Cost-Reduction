# 🚢 Ocean Freight Cost Reduction – Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on leveraging **data analytics and machine learning (XGBoost)** to reduce ocean freight costs through accurate forecasting and insight generation.

> Better forecasting → Better contract negotiation → Better cost efficiency

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Analyze freight cost behavior across **Ports / Year / Month**
- Build a predictive model to forecast freight rates
- Evaluate performance with real business metrics
- Provide a scalable data pipeline for future enhancements
